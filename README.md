# t3n.Neos.Debug

The t3n.Neos.Debug package is a small helper package to add a debug panel to your Neos CMS website. At this point in time you're able to debug your content cache configuration as well as sql queries.

## Installation & configuration

Install the package via composer

```
composer require t3n/neos-debug
```

The debug mode is disabled by default. To enable it add this to your Settings.yaml

```yaml
t3n:
  Neos:
    Debug:
      enabled: true
```

_Disclaimer: Once the debug mode is enabled you might expose sensitive data. Make sure to **not** use this in production. At least be warned_

In a previous version of this package your current user needed a specific role as well. We dropped this requirement for now as you could not use this package if you don't have a frontend login on your site. Once the package is active it will render some metadata in your html output.

To get the debugger running you now need to include some javascript and css to acutally render the debug console. This package ships two fusion prototypes to include all resources. If your Document extends `Neos.Neos:Page` you don't need to include anything. We already added the resources to `Neos.Neos:Page` prototype.

## Usage

To enable the cache visualization open your browsers developer console and execute
`__enable_neos_debug__()`. This will bring up the debug console at the bottom of your screen.

### üî¶ Inspect

Once you enable the inspect mode a visualization will pop up and add overlays on your cached parts. Cached parts are marked green, uncached red and dynamic caches are marked yellow. If you hover the loupe you will also see some meta data regarding the cache.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Cache

This module will add a new modal including some statistics regarding cache hits and misses as well as a table of all rendered cache entries.

### üóÑ SQL

In addition to the content cache we're also exposing some debug SQL informations and statistics. It will also detect slow queries. You can configure from when a query should be marked as slow:

```yaml
t3n:
  Neos:
    Debug:
      sql:
        # Set when a query should be considered as slow query. In ms
        slowQueryAfter: 10
```

### üö´ Close

To shutdown the debug console simply close it. If you'd like to persist the active debug state you can add a `true` to the method

```
__enable_neos_debug__(true)
```

This will set a cookie and the debug mode will still be active after a page refresh.
